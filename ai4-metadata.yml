title: Train an image classifier
summary: Train your own image classifier with your custom dataset. It comes also pretrained on the 1K ImageNet classes.
description: |-
  The deep learning revolution has brought significant advances in a number of fields [1], primarily linked to image and speech recognition. 
  The standardization of image classification tasks like the [ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/) 
  [2] has resulted in a reliable way to compare top performing architectures. 

  This Docker container contains the tools to train an image classifier on your personal dataset.
  It is a highly customizable tool that let's you choose between tens of different [top performing architectures](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-applications) and training parameters. 

  The container also comes with a pretrained general-purpose image classifier trained on ImageNet. 
  The PREDICT method expects an RGB image as input (or the url of an RGB image) and will return a JSON with the top 5 predictions.
